# 1. Problem Statement

A clearly defined problem statement sets the foundation for the entire AI project, providing precise guidance on objectives, scope, and expected outcomes. It ensures technical teams fully understand the project's focus, preventing misunderstandings and misdirection. The problem statement should articulate the technical challenges faced, the reasons traditional methods are insufficient, and the potential impact on the business if the issues remain unresolved.


Tips:

Clearly articulate technical issues to ensure a unified understanding among stakeholders.
Quantify impacts whenever possible, including time, cost, or performance implications.
Explicitly compare AI solutions to traditional or manual alternatives.
Validate assumptions and transparently describe known limitations.

Warnings:
Do not assume technical contexts are implicitly understood; always provide sufficient details.
Avoid ambiguity or overly broad problem descriptions, as they can lead to misalignment and inefficient resource allocation.


# 2. Data & Knowledge

Quality data and effective knowledge management directly influence AI project outcomes. Clearly defined data sources, thorough preprocessing methods, and robust knowledge retrieval mechanisms ensure the project's success.

Tips:

Clearly specify data attributes such as volume, format, and quality.
Document detailed preprocessing steps and augmentation methods.
Define clear retrieval strategies and technologies, such as embedding techniques and vector databases.

Warnings:
Proactively address data privacy, ethical, and compliance requirements; avoid retroactive adjustments.

# 3. AI Approach & Methodology

This section outlines the strategic and technical pathways, clarifying model choices, fine-tuning strategies, and detailed prompt engineering practices.

Tips:
Explicitly justify chosen AI methods, including model architectures and fine-tuning approaches.
Provide comprehensive documentation on prompt engineering and retrieval strategy rationale.
Clearly articulate optimization processes and anticipated technical trade-offs.

Warnings:
Avoid generic or overly theoretical explanations; ensure practical applicability and clarity.


# 4. Performance Metrics & Evaluation Rules

Clear metrics and evaluation rules provide objective criteria to assess project performance and determine success, ensuring transparency and reliability in outcomes.

Tips:
Align selected metrics closely with specific AI methods used, such as accuracy, coherence, or hallucination rates.
Clearly define performance thresholds and target benchmarks.
Detail comprehensive monitoring and observability practices to track ongoing effectiveness.

Warnings:
Avoid overly optimistic or insufficiently precise metrics.
Ensure evaluation metrics align directly with business goals and technical requirements.


# 5. Resources & Stakeholders

Clearly identifying the necessary technical expertise, resources, and stakeholder responsibilities facilitates effective collaboration and resource allocation.

Tips:
Explicitly define required technical skills and competencies for the project team.
Clearly articulate roles, responsibilities, and expectations of all stakeholders involved.
Detail necessary computational resources, software, and infrastructure clearly.

Warnings:
Avoid ambiguity in team roles, responsibilities, and expectations.
Ensure adequate stakeholder communication and engagement to avoid misalignment.


# 6. Risks & Mitigation

Proactively identifying and managing risks, including technical, operational, ethical, and compliance challenges, is essential for successful project execution.

Tips:
Explicitly outline anticipated technical, ethical, and operational risks.
Develop robust, clear, and actionable mitigation strategies for each identified risk.
Ensure continuous monitoring and risk reassessment throughout the project lifecycle.

Warnings:
Do not overlook ethical considerations, bias risks, or security vulnerabilities.
Clearly document risk mitigation responsibilities and accountability.


# 7. Deployment & Integration

Effective planning for deployment and integration ensures a smooth transition from development to operational environments, maintaining scalability, reliability, and operational efficiency.

Tips:
Provide detailed descriptions of integration interfaces, APIs, and required data formats.
Clearly specify operational management, scalability considerations, and maintenance processes.
Document version management and rollback strategies comprehensively.

Warnings:
Avoid underestimating infrastructure complexity or operational requirements.
Ensure clear alignment with existing IT systems and organizational processes.


# 8. Timeline & Milestones

A structured timeline with clearly defined milestones ensures accountability, resource efficiency, and effective progress monitoring throughout the AI project.

Tips:
Clearly define project phases with realistic durations and specific technical checkpoints.
Align milestones explicitly with technical deliverables and evaluation criteria.
Incorporate contingency buffers to accommodate unforeseen challenges or adjustments.

Warnings:
Avoid overly ambitious timelines that neglect realistic constraints or necessary validation periods.
Ensure continuous alignment with stakeholders on milestone definitions and expectations.
